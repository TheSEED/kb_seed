=head1 all_entities_ContigChunk

Return all instances of the ContigChunk entity.

ContigChunks are strings of DNA thought of as being a
string in a 4-character alphabet with an associated ID.  We
allow a broader alphabet that includes U (for RNA) and
the standard ambiguity characters.

Example:

    all_entities_ContigChunk -a 

would retrieve all entities of type ContigChunk and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The ContigChunk entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsSectionOf ContigSequence


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item sequence

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
