=head1 all_entities_Location

Return all instances of the Location entity.

A location is a region of the cell where reaction compounds
originate from or are transported to (e.g. cell wall, extracellular,
cytoplasm).

Example:

    all_entities_Location -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Location and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Location entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsInstantiatedBy LocationInstance

=item IsParticipatingAt LocalizedCompound


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item mod_date

=item name

=item source_id

=item hierarchy

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
