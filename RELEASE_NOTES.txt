OVERVIEW
--------

The kb_seed module contains an import of a large body of code from the SEED project. These
imports are performed on a periodic basis as new features developed on the SEED side
are required in the KBase codebase.

VERSION - 1.057 - May 24, 2013.
-------------------------------

Latest import fixes KB bug 65.
